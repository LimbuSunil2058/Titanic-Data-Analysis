# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to understand the factors that influenced the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The dataset includes information such as passenger class, age, gender, fare, and survival status.

## Findings
- **Survival Rate:** Approximately 38% of passengers survived.
- **Gender Impact:** Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to male passengers.
- **Passenger Class:** Passengers in first class had a higher survival rate compared to those in second and third classes.
- **Age:** Children had a higher survival rate, while older passengers had a lower survival rate.
- **Alone:** Passengers who travelled alone had a lower survival rate.

## Conclusion
The analysis revealed that gender, passenger class,family size and age were significant factors influencing survival on the Titanic. Female passengers, those in first class, and children were more likely to survive. This EDA provides valuable insights that could be used to build predictive models for survival.
